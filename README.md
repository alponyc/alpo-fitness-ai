ALPO Fitness AI: Tactical Intelligence OS
The Health Operating System for High-Stakes Professionals.

🧠 Project Vision
ALPO (Adaptive Lifestyle Performance Optimization) is a reasoning engine designed for executives who cannot afford the "Willpower Gap." Unlike static tracking apps, ALPO utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to audit real-time health data against a secure, clinical-first data silo.

🛠️ The Technical Stack
Engine: Vite + React + TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Industrial Slate & Emerald Theme)

Logic: RAG-Audit Framework for nutritional and training pivots.

Deployment: Lovable + GitHub Sync.

🚀 Key Features
Executive MD Vault: A clinical guardrail system containing surgical history (e.g., Left Elbow) and professional stress metrics (37.5hr work week).

Alpo-Vision Scanner: Real-time auditing of nutritional data against the MD Vault to identify inflammatory triggers.

Adaptive Protocol Pivots: Automatically swaps high-risk movements for safe alternatives based on live biometric and injury data.

📈 Proof of Concept (The Genesis)
Context: Successfully managed a job-loss induced cortisol rebound (202.8 lbs).

Current Result: Verified 196.2 lb handle.

Net Impact: 8.8 lbs reduced in 4 days through AI-driven systemic discipline.
